### This is My First Project using TAILWIND CSS Framework.

<b>How i Started :</b>

1. Tailwind is very easy to use and to get your grasp on if you have good knowledge about CSS.

2. [ Tailwind's documentation ](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) has got one of the best explanations for the same, that is its core concepts, how it works, and its usage.

<b>Difficulties I faced :</b>

1. To me, the process of setting up your Tailwind project was a little difficult at first, though as time passed everything was clear to be.


2. Another problem I faced was since we were styling our code inside our HTML file (classes to be precised), the code started looking very confusing especially when you have to heavily style your elements.

>The project is a part of the learning from  [ Sir Hitesh Choudhary's ](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) course on FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT WEB DEVELOPER. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
